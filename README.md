# Artifical Potential Field Navigation

The repository contains scripts to simulate artificial potential field navigation for a robot. The scripts use attractive and repulsive forces to navigate the robot towards a goal while avoiding obstacles.

## Running the Scripts

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/snktshrma/artificial-potential-field-path-planning.git
cd artificial-potential-field-path-planning
```

2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the script for static obstacles:

```bash
python static_obstacles.py
```

4. Run the script for dynamic obstacles:

```bash
python dynamic_obstacles.py
```
